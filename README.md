# Systems Modelling of Dynamic Systems
Developed and analyzed mathematical and simulation models for dynamic systems, including:

- **Linear Pendulum Modeling:** Derived and validated a linearized mathematical model for a pendulum system using small-angle approximations, state-space representations, and Simulink simulations. Evaluated linear versus nonlinear dynamics under varying initial conditions.

- **Car Suspension System:** Modeled a simplified three-mass car suspension system using Newtonian mechanics and Hookeâ€™s law. Formulated equations of motion, applied Laplace transforms, and developed transfer functions and state-space representations. Created and analyzed signal flow graphs and block diagrams to visualize system behavior.

- **Torpedo Depth Control:** Designed and simulated a control system for torpedo depth regulation under varying conditions using MATLAB/Simulink. Investigated the impact of gain and speed on transient performance metrics like rise time, overshoot, and settling time, while comparing linear and nonlinear system responses.
